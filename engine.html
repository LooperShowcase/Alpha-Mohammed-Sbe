  <p>
    Google Search (also known simply as Google or Google.com) is a search engine
    provided and operated by Google. Handling more than 3.5 billion searches per
    day, it has a 92% share of the global search engine market. It is the
    most-visited website in the world. Additionally, it is the most searched and

    indicate economic, social and health trends. Data about the frequency of use
    of search terms on Google can be openly inquired via Google Trends and have
    been shown to correlate with flu outbreaks and unemployment levels, and
